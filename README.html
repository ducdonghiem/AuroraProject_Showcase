<h1 id="aurora-scheduler">Aurora scheduler</h1>
<p>This website helps UofM students plan their class schedules easily
and conveniently before registration.</p>
<p>It takes in user input, which are the courses they want to take in a
semester (currently not applicable for Summer terms). Then, using
real-time data scrapped from Aurora, it shows all possible scheduling
options for the user’s registration (no class overlaps). It also
recommends the best option with the fewest class days and minimal time
gaps between classes.</p>
<p>The customization section allows the user to view schedules that
accommodate their specific time preferences.</p>
<p>This website is still under development with more features and
improvements to come.</p>
